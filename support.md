## FAQs

#### Are the SDKs open source?

Yes! All [our SDKs are open sourced](https://github.com/crittrco/) and MIT licenced. If you have any improvements you would like to make, we are always welcome to pull requests. If you're interested in helping
out with developing an SDK, or maintaining an existing SDK, you can always [contact us](#contact-us).

#### How can I help out improving or developing an SDK?

#### What is pricing like?

Currently we're testing out the main functionality of Crittr and are offering it for free. Soon, studios will pay a monthly subscription fee depending on the amount of members, size of attachments, and number of reports they send. If you are a solo-dev working on a hobby project, or are just looking to test Crittr, don't fret â€” there will also be a free plan included.

#### What game engines or languages do you support?

Currently, we only support the Unity game engine but we have plans to expand to other game engines and languages. If you have any suggestions or want to develop an SDK for another engine or language, [contact us](#contact-us).

#### Which game engine do you plan on supporting next?

Our goal is to support all the major game engines (Unity, Unreal, CryEngine, etc.) as well as mobile game specific engines. In the future, we would like to expand to generic programming languages as well. If you have any suggestions or want to develop an SDK for another engine or language, [contact us](#contact-us)!
