# Getting Started

To get started with Crittr you need to first set up an account using the [web dashboard](https://dashboard.crittr.co). After signing up, you'll be prompted to join or start a [studio](/concepts#studio) where you can create [projects](/concepts#projects) to manage your [reports](/concepts#reports). Once you're done creating your account, move on to the next section to install one of the SDKs and start sending your reports!

## Install SDK

* [Unity](/unity-sdk)

## Manage your reports

If you successfully set up an SDK and sent your first report, you can view them in the [web dashboard](https://dashboard.crittr.co/reports). Here you can filter, modify, or select your reports. Each report comes bundled with player-generated content and metadata which is described [in more detail here](/concepts#reports).

## Next steps

Congrats on setting up Crittr ðŸŽ‰! By now you should be able to send and receive your reports. But this is only the beginning, there are a ton of bugs out there in the wild and now it's time to start squashing them for good!

Good luck, and we look forward to helping you in whatever part of the development journey you're on.
